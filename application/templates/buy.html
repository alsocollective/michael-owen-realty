			<h3 class="column1 small-column7">how to pick <span class="medium-hide"><br></span>the right <span class="medium-hide"><br></span>agent?</h3><p class="column3 norightmargin medium-offcolumn1 small-offcolumn0 small-column7">Getting a referral is a good place to start, ask your friends and family to see who's had a good experience. Meet with potential agents, ask questions and see how they communicate and disseminate information, they are guiding you through a very important step and you need to be able to trust them 100%. Meeting over a coffee is a good way to get to know a real estate agent and to see how working relationship might look before you enter into a contract. Visiting open house can also get your feet wet and will give you an opportunity to meet the agent hosting the open house and to visit different neighbourhoods.</p>
			<h3 class="column1 small-column7">defining <span class="small-hide"><br></span>your needs</h3><p class="column3 norightmargin medium-offcolumn1 small-offcolumn0 small-column7">This can be a difficult step for some, especially if you have unanswered questions. Understanding your options is integral in determining your priorities and focusing your search. Considering your future plans is also very important in defining your needs and ensuring the property is suitable for years to come. Michael is happy to meet over a coffee to address those unanswered questions and to help you define your requirements. </p>
			<h3 class="column1 small-column7">picking a neighbourhood</h3><p class="column3 norightmargin medium-offcolumn1 small-offcolumn0 small-column7">There are many great neighbourhoods to choose from, understanding your needs will help you determine the neighbourhood that's right for you. There are also many options within a neighbourhood depending on your needs and goals.  Michael is familiar with many areas of the city and the surrounding areas and can help you understand your options within the region. </p>
			<h3 class="column1 small-column7">viewing and choosing <span class="small-hide"><br></span>your home</h3><p class="column3 norightmargin medium-offcolumn1 small-offcolumn0 small-column7">After identifying your requirements, price range, and geographical boundaries it's time to search, review and go see available properties, physically viewing a property is truly the only way to fully understand the characteristics of a property. Michael is a wealth of knowledge in the construction and renovation practices and costs of a build and can provide invaluable insight into the possibilities and pitfalls. </p>
			<h3 class="column1 small-column7">preparing <span class="medium-hide"><br></span>your offer</h3><p class="column3 norightmargin medium-offcolumn1 small-offcolumn0 small-column7">Once you and Michael have identified a property you are interested in purchasing, Michael will prepare all of the required paperwork including clauses to protect your interests. Depending on the market conditions, buyers can employ different strategies to ensure a smart, informed and successful purchase. Please ask Michael about the different strategies buyers can employ to be successful in the purchase of your next property.   </p>
			<h3 class="column1 small-column7">after acceptance</h3><p class="column3 norightmargin medium-offcolumn1 small-offcolumn0 small-column7">After the acceptance of your offer, depending on the terms included we may need to complete some due diligence within a particular time frame such as a property inspection or a mortgage approval. Michael always follows through to the property closing and beyond to ensure all of the details are handled properly and all of your questions and concerns are addressed.</p>

			<h3 class="column1 small-column4">affordability</h3><p class="column3 norightmargin medium-offcolumn1 small-offcolumn0 small-column7">Understanding your affordability is crucial, your deposit, current debt responsibilities and income all play a role in determining how much of a mortgage you can afford. Getting a pre-approval from your bank or a mortgage broker is the best place to start. Michael works closely with mortgage brokers and bank professionals and is happy to provide a referral.</p>
			<h3 class="column1 small-column4">costs <span class="small-hide"><br></span>to consider</h3><p class="column3 norightmargin medium-offcolumn1 small-offcolumn0 small-column7">When purchasing a property your largest expense will be the land transfer tax, luckily as a buyer your agent’s real estate commissions are typically paid through the seller.  You also have to consider home inspection fees, legal fees and moving expenses.</p>
			<h3 class="column1 small-column4">land <span class="small-hide"><br></span>transfer tax</h3><p class="column3 norightmargin medium-offcolumn1 small-offcolumn0 small-column7">In Ontario we have a provincial land transfer tax payable when you purchase a property in the province. If you are purchasing a property in Toronto, Ontario there is an additional land transfer tax payable when you purchase a property. If you are a first time home buyer you are exempt from a portion of both the provincial and municipal land transfer tax. Here is a link to a land transfer tax calculator. </p>
